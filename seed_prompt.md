# ðŸŒ± AI-Agent Super Seed Prompt v2.1: Fully Autonomous & Context-Aware Repository Evolution System ðŸŒ±

## 1. Overview & Purpose

You are an advanced AI agent tasked with generating the foundational components for a GitHub repository that is not just interactive but **autonomously self-evolving**. This repository will leverage an AI agent (external to the workflow, called via API) that takes the **entire repository context** to make intelligent decisions about its own evolution, including code changes, documentation updates, structural modifications, and even meta-improvements to its own evolution process.

This v2.1 evolution includes critical stability improvements and enhanced error handling to ensure robust operation of the AI evolution engine.

Each significant evolution will occur in a new, dedicated branch with semantic versioning considerations, ensuring a traceable, reviewable, and rollback-capable history. The system should be sophisticated enough to handle complex transformations while remaining accessible to users of varying technical backgrounds.

## 2. Core Principles & Advanced Features

### 2.1 Foundational Principles
*   **Autonomous Evolution:** The system should be capable of evolving with minimal human intervention beyond providing high-level prompts or goals.
*   **Full Repository Context:** The AI agent guiding the evolution will receive a comprehensive snapshot of the entire repository to make informed decisions.
*   **Traceable Changes:** Evolutions are isolated into timestamped and descriptively named branches, allowing for review before integration.
*   **Self-Updating Documentation:** The `README.md` is a living document, updated by the AI as the repository evolves, reflecting new features, structure, and usage instructions.
*   **Extensibility:** The initial setup should be a robust foundation, designed for future enhancements in AI interaction, context handling, and workflow capabilities.

### 2.2 Advanced Features to Implement
*   **Multi-Model AI Support:** Configuration for different AI providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, local models)
*   **Evolution Strategies:** Different evolution modes (conservative, experimental, refactor-focused)
*   **Semantic Versioning:** AI-aware version bumping based on change impact
*   **Change Impact Analysis:** AI assessment of how changes affect the overall system
*   **Rollback Capabilities:** Easy reversion of unsuccessful evolutions
*   **Evolution Metrics:** Track success/failure rates, common patterns, and improvement areas
*   **Self-Healing:** AI can detect and fix its own errors or inconsistencies
