# AI Evolution Workflows - Standards & Configuration

This document defines common patterns, configurations, and standards used across all AI Evolution workflows for consistency and maintainability.

**Version:** 0.3.0

## Common Environment Variables

These should be used consistently across all workflows:

```yaml
env:
  EVOLUTION_VERSION: "0.3.0"
  WORKFLOW_TYPE: "descriptive_name"  # e.g., "manual_evolution", "scheduled_evolution", "testing_automation"
```

## Standard Permissions

All workflows should use these permissions:

```yaml
permissions:
  contents: write
  pull-requests: write
  issues: write
```

## Standard Checkout Configuration

Use this checkout configuration for consistency:

```yaml
- name: üå± Prepare Evolution Environment
  uses: actions/checkout@v4
  with:
    fetch-depth: 0
    token: ${{ secrets.PAT_TOKEN_TOKEN }}
```

## Common Input Parameters

### Growth Modes

- `conservative`: Safe, minimal changes with thorough validation
- `adaptive`: Balanced approach with moderate changes and validation
- `experimental`: Advanced features and experimental changes
- `test-automation`: Focus on testing improvements and automation
- `build-optimization`: Focus on build and CI/CD improvements
- `error-resilience`: Focus on error handling and recovery patterns
- `ci-cd-enhancement`: Focus on CI/CD pipeline improvements

### Evolution Types (for daily evolution)

- `consistency`: Fix inconsistencies across files and configurations
- `error_fixing`: Resolve errors, bugs, and issues
- `documentation`: Improve documentation quality and coverage
- `code_quality`: Enhance code quality, patterns, and standards
- `security_updates`: Apply security improvements and updates

### Intensity Levels

- `minimal`: Small, safe changes with low risk
- `moderate`: Medium-sized improvements with moderate risk
- `comprehensive`: Large-scale improvements with higher impact

## Standard Environment Setup Pattern

All workflows should follow this pattern:

```yaml
- name: üõ†Ô∏è Setup Environment
  run: |
    if [ ! -f "./scripts/setup-environment.sh" ]; then
      echo "‚ùå Setup script not found!"
      exit 1
    fi
    chmod +x ./scripts/setup-environment.sh
    ./scripts/setup-environment.sh
```

## Script Execution Pattern

Always make scripts executable and include error handling:

```yaml
- name: üß¨ Script Name
  run: |
    chmod +x ./scripts/script-name.sh
    ./scripts/script-name.sh arg1 arg2
```

## Dry Run Support Pattern

Include dry run support in all evolution workflows:

```yaml
- name: üîç Dry Run - Preview Changes
  if: env.DRY_RUN == 'true'
  run: |
    echo "üîç DRY RUN MODE - Changes that would be applied:"
    if [ -f "/tmp/evolution_response.json" ]; then
      cat "/tmp/evolution_response.json" | jq -r '.changes[] | "\(.type): \(.file)"' 2>/dev/null || echo "No changes preview available"
    fi
```

## Error Handling Standards

- Use `set -euo pipefail` for robust error handling in multi-line scripts
- Include validation steps before executing critical operations
- Provide meaningful error messages with actionable guidance
- Use conditional execution with proper if statements

## Naming Conventions

- **Step Names**: Use emojis for improved readability (üå±, üõ†Ô∏è, üß¨, üîç, etc.)
- **Job Names**: Use descriptive names that clearly indicate purpose
- **Variables**: Use UPPER_CASE for environment variables, lowercase for local variables
- **Files**: Use kebab-case for filenames and snake_case for script names

## File Path Standards

- **Temp Directory**: Use `/tmp/` for temporary files
- **Scripts**: Use relative paths `./scripts/` for script execution
- **Outputs**: Store workflow outputs in `/tmp/` for consistency
- **Configs**: Store configurations in predictable locations

## Required Input Parameters

All workflows should support these common inputs:

```yaml
inputs:
  dry_run:
    description: 'Run in simulation mode without making actual changes'
    required: false
    default: false
    type: boolean
```

## Token Usage

- Use `${{ secrets.PAT_TOKEN_TOKEN }}` instead of custom PAT tokens when possible
- Only use custom tokens when additional permissions are required
- Document any special token requirements in workflow comments

## Version Management

- Update version numbers consistently across all workflows
- Document breaking changes in workflow comments
- Maintain backward compatibility when possible

## Testing Standards

- Include validation steps in all workflows
- Test scripts independently before integration
- Provide meaningful output for debugging
- Include rollback procedures for critical operations
