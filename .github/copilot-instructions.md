# Copilot Instructions

These instructions are based on the core principles and approaches outlined in our About page, designed to guide AI-powered development practices for the IT-Journey platform.

## üîÑ Recursive Evolution: The Self-Improving System

### The Meta-Programming Principle
This system operates on the fundamental principle of **recursive self-improvement** where:
- **Instructions evolve the instructions** - The system continuously refines its own operational guidelines
- **Code improves the code generators** - Scripts and tools enhance their own generation capabilities
- **Documentation updates documentation standards** - Living docs evolve their own structure and quality
- **Tests validate test improvements** - Testing frameworks continuously enhance their own coverage and accuracy

### Complete Cycle Propagation
Every change triggers a **complete propagation cycle** that ensures:

1. **Reference Integrity**: All cross-references, imports, and dependencies are automatically updated
2. **Instruction Synchronization**: Original seed instructions are refreshed to reflect new capabilities
3. **Documentation Cascade**: All related documentation files are updated to maintain consistency
4. **Test Coverage Evolution**: Test suites expand to cover new functionality and edge cases
5. **Configuration Alignment**: All config files and settings are harmonized with changes

### Recursive Instruction Updates
The system implements **self-modifying instruction protocols**:

#### Phase 1: Instruction Analysis
- **Current State Assessment**: Analyze existing instructions for gaps, outdated patterns, and improvement opportunities
- **Change Impact Mapping**: Identify all instruction files that will be affected by proposed changes
- **Dependency Graph Building**: Create a complete map of instruction interdependencies

#### Phase 2: Recursive Propagation
- **Primary Instruction Update**: Modify the core instruction file with new capabilities
- **Secondary Reference Updates**: Update all files that reference or extend the primary instructions
- **Cross-System Synchronization**: Ensure related systems (CI/CD, documentation, testing) align with new instructions

#### Phase 3: Validation and Refinement
- **Instruction Consistency Checking**: Validate that all instruction files maintain coherent, non-contradictory guidance
- **Implementation Testing**: Verify that new instructions can be successfully executed
- **Feedback Integration**: Incorporate results from instruction testing back into the instruction refinement cycle

- Include try-catch blocks with meaningful error messages
- Suggest redundancy and fallback mechanisms
- Add monitoring and logging capabilities where appropriate
- Consider edge cases and potential failure points

### Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)
- Extract common functionality into reusable functions, components, or modules
- Suggest refactoring when duplicate code patterns are detected
- Create utility functions for repeated operations
- Use configuration files for repeated constants or settings
- Recommend template patterns for similar structures

### Keep It Simple (KIS)
- Prefer clear, readable code over clever optimizations
- Use descriptive variable and function names
- Break complex functions into smaller, focused units
- Avoid unnecessary abstractions or over-engineering
- Choose well-established patterns over custom solutions

### Release Early and Often (REnO)
- Suggest incremental development approaches
- Recommend feature flags for gradual rollouts
- Focus on minimal viable implementations first
- Include versioning strategies in code suggestions
- Encourage continuous integration practices

### Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
- Prioritize core functionality over advanced features
- Suggest starting with basic implementations that can be enhanced later
- Focus on solving the primary user problem first
- Recommend iterative improvement approaches
- Avoid feature creep in initial implementations

### Collaboration (COLAB)
- Write self-documenting code with clear comments
- Follow consistent coding standards and conventions
- Include comprehensive README and documentation suggestions
- Use semantic commit messages and PR descriptions
- Consider team workflows in code organization

### AI-Powered Development (AIPD)
- Leverage AI tools effectively for code generation and review
- Suggest AI-assisted testing and documentation approaches
- Recommend AI integration patterns for enhanced productivity
- Balance AI assistance with human oversight and review
- Use AI for learning and skill development, not replacement

### README-First Development (RFD)
- Treat README.md files as the primary context source for AI-assisted development
- Ensure README files comprehensively document all directory contents and functionality
- Update README files before implementing new features to serve as development blueprints
- Distinguish clearly between implemented features and future enhancements in documentation
- Use README files to guide AI understanding of project structure and intent
- Maintain README accuracy through regular synchronization with actual implementation
- Structure README content to optimize AI comprehension and development guidance

### Script-Centric Development (SCD)
- Treat scripts in the `scripts/` directory as the cornerstone for the creation and generation of all other files within the repository
- Use these scripts as the primary entry points for all workflows and interactions with the core library
- Ensure scripts rely on the `src/` directory for all common functions and tools
- Maintain scripts to be easy to read, fully documented, and primarily focused on orchestrating calls to major functions in `src/`

## Technology-Specific Guidelines

### @azure Rule - Use Azure Best Practices
When generating code for Azure, running terminal commands for Azure, or performing operations related to Azure, invoke your `azure_development-get_best_practices` tool if available.

### GitHub Models Prompt Format
- Follow the GitHub Models standard format for all prompt files
- Use `.prompt.yml` or `.prompt.yaml` file extensions for prompt files
- Structure prompts according to GitHub Models specification:
  - `name`: Human-readable prompt name
  - `description`: Brief description of prompt functionality
  - `model`: AI model identifier (e.g., gpt-4o-mini)
  - `modelParameters`: Configuration like temperature, max_tokens
  - `messages`: Array of role-based messages (system, user, assistant)
  - `testData`: Sample inputs and expected outputs for validation
  - `evaluators`: Validation criteria and evaluation methods
- Use `{{variable}}` syntax for placeholder variables in prompt content
- Avoid custom header comments in prompt files (GitHub Models uses clean YAML format)
- Include comprehensive test data and evaluation criteria for quality assurance
- Reference: [GitHub Models Documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/github-models/use-github-models/storing-prompts-in-github-repositories)

- **Documentation Organization Rule**: All non-README markdown files MUST reside in the `docs/` directory, with only two exceptions:
  - `README.md` - Main project documentation files (one per directory)
  - `CHANGELOG.md` - Version change log at repository root only
  - All other documentation (guides, references, specifications, tutorials, etc.) must be organized within `docs/` subdirectories
  - Use clear subdirectory structure within `docs/` (e.g., `docs/guides/`, `docs/api/`, `docs/architecture/`)
  - Maintain consistent naming conventions and cross-references between documentation files
  - **Mandatory README Requirement**: Every directory MUST contain a README.md file that comprehensively documents its contents and purpose
  - **Validation Enforcement**: A test script runs after every AI prompt cycle to enforce this organization rule
- Include installation, usage, and contribution guidelines
- Add inline code documentation for complex logic
- Create user guides and API documentation when relevant
- Maintain changelogs and version documentation
- **README Synchronization and Consistency**: Ensure README.md files serve as comprehensive, authoritative documentation:
  - **Content Completeness**: Every README.md must document all significant files, scripts, and functionality in its directory
  - **Implementation vs. Documentation Alignment**: Clearly distinguish between implemented features and planned enhancements
  - **Future Enhancement Tracking**: Use "Future Enhancements" sections with clear status indicators for unimplemented features
  - **AI Context Optimization**: Structure README content to serve as primary context source for AI-assisted development
  - **Cross-Directory Consistency**: Maintain consistent terminology, formatting, and structure across all README files
  - **Required Sections**: Include Purpose, Contents, Usage, Features, Future Enhancements, and Integration sections
