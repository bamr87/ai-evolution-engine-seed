# Testing & Build Automation Evolution Seed Prompt

## Context
This seed evolved from solving real-world testing and build automation issues in the zer0-mistakes Jekyll theme project. The evolution demonstrates how practical problem-solving can be encoded into reusable patterns.

## Evolution Request
Generate the next iteration of testing and build automation tools that address the following growth areas:

### Core Requirements
1. **Enhanced Error Detection** - Expand the test framework to catch more edge cases and provide even more specific error messages
2. **Automated Recovery Systems** - Build self-healing capabilities that can automatically resolve common issues without human intervention  
3. **Cross-Platform Compatibility** - Ensure scripts work seamlessly across macOS, Linux, and Windows environments
4. **Performance Optimization** - Add build time monitoring and optimization suggestions
5. **Security Integration** - Include dependency vulnerability scanning and security best practices

### Growth Triggers
- When tests encounter new failure patterns not covered by current framework
- When build processes become more complex and require additional automation
- When manual intervention is needed for error resolution
- When cross-platform compatibility issues arise
- When security vulnerabilities are discovered in dependencies

### Success Metrics
- Zero manual intervention required for common build/test failures
- Sub-second error detection and diagnosis
- 100% test coverage for all supported project types
- Automated security scanning integration
- Cross-platform script compatibility

### Innovation Areas
- AI-powered test case generation based on code analysis
- Predictive failure detection before issues occur  
- Intelligent build optimization based on project characteristics
- Automated documentation generation from test results
- Self-updating test frameworks that learn from failures

### Output Requirements
Generate updated seed files that include:

1. **Enhanced test.sh** - More comprehensive validation with automated fixes
2. **Intelligent build.sh** - Project-type detection with optimized build strategies
3. **Security scanner integration** - Automated vulnerability detection
4. **Performance monitoring** - Build time analysis and optimization suggestions
5. **Cross-platform compatibility** - Scripts that work on all major operating systems
6. **Self-healing mechanisms** - Automatic resolution of common issues
7. **Documentation generation** - Automated README and changelog updates

### Evolutionary Constraints
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing zer0-mistakes theme structure
- Follow Design for Failure (DFF) principles throughout
- Keep scripts simple and readable (Don't Repeat Yourself principle)
- Ensure minimal dependencies for easy adoption
- Include comprehensive error messages and debugging information

### Learning Integration
Incorporate lessons learned from:
- Real-world gemspec validation failures and their solutions
- YAML front matter parsing issues and proper escaping techniques
- File permission problems and automated correction methods
- Build artifact verification challenges and alternative approaches
- Dependency specification warnings and semantic versioning best practices

The next evolution should build upon these proven patterns while expanding capabilities to handle more complex scenarios and provide even greater automation and reliability.
