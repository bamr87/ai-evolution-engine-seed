### Quick Start with Organized Testing
```bash
# Validate all workflows locally
./tests/workflows/test-all-workflows-local.sh

# Test daily evolution workflow
./tests/workflows/test-daily-evolution-local.sh

# Advanced workflow debugging
./tests/workflows/test-workflow.sh setup

# Test evolved seed functionality
./tests/seed/test-evolved-seed.sh

# Test modular library system
./tests/lib/test-modular-library.sh

# Validate migration completed successfully
./tests/validate-test-migration.sh
```

### Migration Guide
See [docs/MODULAR_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md](docs/MODULAR_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md) for complete migration instructions and best practices.

> 🧪 **Now with organized test framework! All test files properly structured in `/tests` with logical subdirectories for maintainable testing.**

This repository is a living experiment in AI-driven software evolution. It's designed to adapt, learn, and improve itself with each "growth cycle," guided by your prompts and an AI engine.

## 🌿 Core Philosophy: Digital Symbiosis

The AI Evolution Engine embodies the principle of symbiotic growth between human creativity and artificial intelligence. Like a seed that grows into a mighty tree, this repository starts with simple instructions and evolves into sophisticated software systems through:

- **🤝 Human-AI Collaboration**: Your vision guides the AI's implementation
- **🔄 Iterative Evolution**: Each cycle builds upon previous learnings
- **🌱 Self-Improving Systems**: The engine becomes smarter with each evolution
- **📚 Knowledge Preservation**: All evolution history is tracked and documented

## 🚀 Quick Start: Plant Your First Seed

### 1. Initial Setup
```bash
# Clone and initialize the seed
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd ai-evolution-engine-seed
./init_setup.sh
```

### 2. Trigger Evolution
```bash
# Manual evolution with custom prompt
gh workflow run ai_evolver.yml \
  --repo your-username/your-repo \
  -f evolution_type="enhancement" \
  -f growth_mode="adaptive" \
  -f prompt="Add user authentication system"

# Or use the local testing approach
./tests/workflows/test-workflow.sh local --prompt "Your enhancement idea"
```

### 3. Monitor Growth
Watch as your prompt gets transformed into actual code changes via Pull Requests with:
- Complete implementation details
- Test coverage
- Documentation updates
- Evolution tracking
