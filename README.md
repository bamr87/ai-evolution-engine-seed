> üå± **This seed is alive and now more stable. Plant it, nurture it with prompts, and watch AI guide its growth.**

This repository is a living experiment in AI-driven software evolution. It's designed to adapt, learn, and improve itself with each "growth cycle," guided by your prompts and an AI engine.

## üåø Core Philosophy: Digital Symbiosis

We believe in software that grows organically, much like a plant from a seed. This involves:
- **Sustainability**: Each evolution builds upon stable foundations.
- **Adaptability**: The system learns and refines its growth patterns.
- **Acceleration**: AI handles boilerplate and complex transformations, letting humans focus on vision.

## üß¨ Seed Anatomy (v0.2.1)

1. **`README.md` (This file)**: A dynamic chronicle of the repository's evolution. The section below is updated by the AI.
    <!-- AI-EVOLUTION-MARKER:START -->
    **Evolutionary State:**
    - Generation: 1
    - Adaptations Logged: 1
    - Last Growth Spurt: 2025-06-16 (jq indexing fixes)
    - Last Prompt: Fix jq indexing errors in GitHub Actions workflow
    <!-- AI-EVOLUTION-MARKER:END -->
2. **`init_setup.sh`**: The germination script. It now sets up a complete v0.2.1 environment, including this README, the AI workflow, and initial configurations.
3. **`.github/workflows/ai_evolver.yml`**: The heart of the growth engine. In v0.2.1, it includes critical bug fixes for JSON handling and improved stability.
4. **`.seed.md`**: The blueprint for the *next* generation. The v0.2.1 workflow generates a `.seed.md` that outlines the path towards v0.3.0, based on the current cycle's "learnings."
5. **`evolution-metrics.json`**: Tracks the quantitative aspects of growth with validated JSON structure.
6. **`.gptignore`**: A file to help guide the AI's focus by excluding irrelevant files from its context.

## üöÄ Quick Germination & Growth

```bash
# 1. Plant the v0.2.0 seed (if you haven't already)
# Ensure you're in an empty directory for a new project
# curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bamr87/ai-evolution-engine/main/init_setup.sh -o init_setup.sh # Get latest
# For this specific v0.2.0, ensure you're using the v0.2.0 version of this script.
bash init_setup.sh

# 2. Set your AI API Key (if using a real AI in the future)
# export AI_API_KEY="your_actual_ai_key_here"

# 3. Initiate a growth cycle via GitHub Actions
gh workflow run ai_evolver.yml -f prompt="Evolve the project to include a basic REST API for tracking plant growth." -f growth_mode="adaptive"
```
*(Requires GitHub CLI `gh` to be installed and authenticated)*

```

## üß™ Seed Vitality Metrics (Aspirational for v0.2.0)

- **Germination Success**: Aiming for >98% clean setup.
- **Simulated Adaptation Rate**: 100% (as it's currently simulated).
- **Documentation Cohesion**: README and code evolve together.

This is more than just a template; it's a call to explore a new way of building software. By planting this seed, you're participating in an experiment to create self-evolving, intelligent applications.
