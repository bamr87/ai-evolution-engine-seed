![Growth Potential](https://img.shields.io/badge/potential-universal-purple.svg)

> üå± **Now with organized documentation! All docs properly structured in `/docs` following best practices for maintainable repositories.**

This repository is a living experiment in AI-driven software evolution. It's designed to adapt, learn, and improve itself with each "growth cycle," guided by your prompts and an AI engine.

## üåø Core Philosophy: Digital Symbiosis

We believe in software that grows organically, much like a plant from a seed. This involves:
- **Sustainability**: Each evolution builds upon stable foundations.
- **Adaptability**: The system learns and refines its growth patterns.
- **Acceleration**: AI handles boilerplate and complex transformations, letting humans focus on vision.

## üìö Documentation Structure

Following our **Documentation Organization Rule**, all documentation resides in the `docs/` directory:

### Core Documentation (Repository Root)

- `README.md` - This file (main project documentation)
- `CHANGELOG.md` - Version history and change tracking

### Organized Documentation (`docs/`)

- `docs/guides/` - User guides and tutorials
- `docs/architecture/` - Technical architecture and design decisions
- `docs/evolution/` - Evolution cycle documentation and metrics
- `docs/workflows/` - CI/CD and automation documentation
- `docs/seeds/` - Seed templates and evolution prompts

**Key Benefits:**

- **Consistency**: Standardized location for all documentation
- **Maintainability**: Easy to find and update documentation
- **Scalability**: Clear structure supports growing documentation needs
- **Collaboration**: Team members always know where to find docs

## üåç Cross-Platform Evolution (New in v0.3.6-seed!)

The AI Evolution Engine now runs everywhere with full cross-platform support:

### üè† Local Development
- **Native execution** on macOS, Linux, and Windows

- **Volume mounting** for seamless local development integration

### ‚òÅÔ∏è CI/CD Ready
- **GitHub Actions** with enhanced authentication handling
- **Multiple token strategies** (PAT_TOKEN, GITHUB_TOKEN)
- **Container option** for pipeline isolation

**Quick Start Options:**
```bash
# Local development (native)
./scripts/local-evolution.sh -p "Your evolution prompt"

# Container development
docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml run evolution-engine \
  ./scripts/local-evolution.sh -p "Your prompt"

# CI/CD (GitHub Actions)

- **Change History**: Maintains detailed logs of which files changed in each release
- **No Backup Files**: Clean workflow without cluttering the repository with backup files
- **Correlation Reports**: Generate detailed reports linking versions to file changes
- **Query Interface**: Rich CLI for exploring version and file history

### üöÄ Version Management Commands

```bash
# Check current version status and change tracking
./scripts/version-manager.sh check-status

# Increment version for evolution cycles with automatic tracking
./scripts/version-integration.sh evolution "Added new features"

# Manual version increment with change correlation
./scripts/version-manager.sh increment patch "Bug fixes and improvements"

# Query version history and correlations
./scripts/version-tracker.sh show-history          # Recent version changes
./scripts/version-tracker.sh correlate-files 0.3.6  # Files changed in version
./scripts/version-tracker.sh file-history README.md # Version history for file

# Generate comprehensive reports
./scripts/version-tracker.sh generate-report markdown report.md
./scripts/version-tracker.sh generate-report json data.json

# Query which files changed in a specific version
./scripts/version-tracker.sh correlate-files --version "0.3.3"

# Show version history for a specific file
./scripts/version-tracker.sh file-history README.md

# Generate comprehensive correlation report
./scripts/version-tracker.sh generate-report --format markdown --output evolution-report.md
```

### üîÑ Enhanced Evolution Integration

The version management system provides complete visibility into evolution cycles:

- **Pre-Evolution**: Captures current state and initializes change tracking
- **During Evolution**: Monitors which files are being modified in real-time
- **Post-Evolution**: Automatically increments version, correlates changes, and updates changelog
- **Change Correlation**: Links version increments to specific file modifications
- **Report Generation**: Creates detailed reports showing file-to-version relationships

### ÔøΩ Change Tracking Features

- **Version-File Correlation**: Easily see which files were modified in any release
- **File-Version History**: Track all versions that affected a specific file
- **Automated Changelog**: Enhanced changelog entries with file-level links
- **Git Integration**: Leverages git metadata for comprehensive change tracking
- **Query Interface**: CLI tools for investigating change history
- **Report Generation**: Markdown, JSON, and CSV export formats

### üìÅ Configuration-Driven Tracking

The AI Evolution Engine includes a **Periodic AI Evolution System** that automatically maintains and improves the repository on a scheduled basis. This system runs specialized AI prompts to handle different aspects of repository health and evolution.

#### üìÖ Scheduled Maintenance

**Weekly Prompts:**
- **Documentation Harmonization** (Mondays): Standardizes documentation styling and formatting
- **Security Scanning** (Wednesdays): Identifies and fixes security vulnerabilities  
- **Changelog Updates** (Fridays): Maintains version history and semantic versioning

**Bi-weekly Prompts:**
- **Test Enhancement** (Tuesdays): Expands test coverage and improves test quality

**Monthly Prompts:**
- **Code Refactoring** (1st): Improves code quality and maintainability
- **Dependency Updates** (15th): Updates dependencies for security and compatibility
- **Performance Optimization** (8th): Optimizes performance bottlenecks
- **Workflow Optimization** (22nd): Improves GitHub Actions efficiency
- **Community Guidelines** (28th): Updates contribution documentation
- **Prompt Refinement** (30th): Improves AI prompt templates themselves

#### üõ°Ô∏è Safety Features

- **Safe Mode**: Conservative changes for critical operations
- **Dry Run Testing**: Test changes without applying them
- **Automatic Backups**: File backups before any modifications
- **Pull Request Creation**: All changes reviewed before merging
- **Rollback Capability**: Easy reversion if issues occur

#### üéØ Manual Execution

You can manually trigger any periodic prompt via GitHub Actions:

1. Go to **Actions** ‚Üí **Periodic AI Evolution Engine**
2. Click **Run workflow**
3. Select specific prompt or use schedule-based selection
4. Choose dry-run mode for testing

**See the [Periodic Prompts Documentation](prompts/templates/README.md) for detailed information.**
