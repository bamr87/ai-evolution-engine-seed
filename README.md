> 🌱 **This seed is alive. Plant it, nurture it with prompts, and watch AI guide its growth.**

This repository is a living experiment in AI-driven software evolution. It's designed to adapt, learn, and improve itself with each "growth cycle," guided by your prompts and an AI engine.

## 🌿 Core Philosophy: Digital Symbiosis

We believe in software that grows organically, much like a plant from a seed. This involves:
- **Sustainability**: Each evolution builds upon stable foundations.
- **Adaptability**: The system learns and refines its growth patterns.
- **Acceleration**: AI handles boilerplate and complex transformations, letting humans focus on vision.

## 🧬 Seed Anatomy (v0.2.0)

1.  **`README.md` (This file)**: A dynamic chronicle of the repository's evolution. The section below is updated by the AI.
    <!-- AI-EVOLUTION-MARKER:START -->
    **Evolutionary State:**
    - Generation: 0
    - Adaptations Logged: 0
    - Last Growth Spurt: Never
    <!-- AI-EVOLUTION-MARKER:END -->
2.  **`init_setup.sh`**: The germination script. It now sets up a complete v0.2.0 environment, including this README, the AI workflow, and initial configurations.
3.  **`.github/workflows/ai_evolver.yml`**: The heart of the growth engine. In v0.2.0, it simulates AI-driven changes more deeply, including README updates and dynamic generation of the next seed.
4.  **`.seed.md`**: The blueprint for the *next* generation. The v0.2.0 workflow generates a `.seed.md` that outlines the path towards v0.3.0, based on the current cycle's "learnings."
5.  **`evolution-metrics.json`**: Tracks the quantitative aspects of growth.
6.  **`.gptignore`**: A new file to help guide the AI's focus by excluding irrelevant files from its context.

## 🚀 Quick Germination & Growth

```bash
# 1. Plant the v0.2.0 seed (if you haven't already)
# Ensure you're in an empty directory for a new project
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bamr87/ai-evolution-engine/main/init_setup.sh -o init_setup.sh
# Note: For a real setup, you'd clone the repo or use a specific version tag.
# This curl command fetches the latest init_setup.sh from main, which might be ahead.
# For this specific v0.2.0, you'd use the v0.2.0 version of init_setup.sh.
bash init_setup.sh

# 2. Set your AI API Key (if using a real AI in the future)
# export AI_API_KEY="your_actual_ai_key_here"

# 3. Initiate a growth cycle via GitHub Actions
gh workflow run ai_evolver.yml -f prompt="Evolve the project to include a basic REST API for tracking plant growth." -f growth_mode="adaptive"
```
*(Requires GitHub CLI `gh` to be installed and authenticated)*

    H --> I[📊 Metrics Updated]
    I --> J[📄 README Updated (see markers)]
    J --> K[🌰 New .seed.md Generated (for v0.3.0)]
    K --> L[✅ PR Created for Review]
    L -- Merge --> A_NEXT[🌱 Evolved Seed (ready for next cycle)]
```

## 🧪 Seed Vitality Metrics (Aspirational for v0.2.0)

- **Germination Success**: Aiming for >98% clean setup.
- **Simulated Adaptation Rate**: 100% (as it's currently simulated).
- **Documentation Cohesion**: README and code evolve together.
