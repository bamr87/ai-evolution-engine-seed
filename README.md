## 🏗️ Modular Architecture (New in v0.3.6-seed!)

The AI Evolution Engine features a completely refactored modular architecture for improved maintainability, testing, and extensibility:

### 📦 Core Libraries

**`src/lib/core/`** - Foundation libraries used across all scripts:

- **`logger.sh`** - Unified logging with color support and CI/local awareness
- **`environment.sh`** - Environment detection, OS handling, and command checking
