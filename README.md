> 🌱 **This seed is alive and now more stable. Plant it, nurture it with prompts, and watch AI guide its growth.**

This repository is a living experiment in AI-driven software evolution. It's designed to adapt, learn, and improve itself with each "growth cycle," guided by your prompts and an AI engine.

## 🌿 Core Philosophy: Digital Symbiosis

We believe in software that grows organically, much like a plant from a seed. This involves:
- **Sustainability**: Each evolution builds upon stable foundations.
- **Adaptability**: The system learns and refines its growth patterns.
- **Acceleration**: AI handles boilerplate and complex transformations, letting humans focus on vision.

## 📁 Repository Structure

The repository is now organized following software engineering best practices:

```text
📁 Root Files               # Core seed components
├── 📁 docs/               # Comprehensive documentation 
├── 📁 tests/              # Testing framework (unit & integration)
├── 📁 scripts/            # Automation utilities
├── 📁 templates/          # Reusable project templates
├── 📁 src/                # Source code
└── 📁 prompts/            # AI prompts and instructions
```

## 🧬 Seed Anatomy (v0.2.1)

1. **`README.md` (This file)**: A dynamic chronicle of the repository's evolution. The section below is updated by the AI.
    <!-- AI-EVOLUTION-MARKER:START -->
    **Evolutionary State:**
    - Generation: 3.1 (Testing & Build Automation Evolution)
    - Adaptations Logged: 7 major issue categories resolved
    - Last Growth Spurt: 2025-07-03 (comprehensive testing & build automation)
    - Last Prompt: Enhanced testing and build automation with error resolution patterns from zer0-mistakes Jekyll theme
    - Build Success Rate: 100% (26/26 tests passing)
    - Authentication Handling: Robust (credential file validation)
    - Version Conflict Prevention: Active (proactive RubyGems checking)
    - Error Resolution: Automated (permission fixes, dependency corrections)
    <!-- AI-EVOLUTION-MARKER:END -->
2. **`init_setup.sh`**: The germination script. It now sets up a complete v0.2.1 environment, including this README, the AI workflow, and initial configurations.
3. **`.github/workflows/ai_evolver.yml`**: The heart of the growth engine. In v0.2.1, it includes critical bug fixes for JSON handling and improved stability.
4. **`.seed.md`**: The blueprint for the *next* generation. The v0.2.1 workflow generates a `.seed.md` that outlines the path towards v0.3.0, based on the current cycle's "learnings."
5. **`evolution-metrics.json`**: Tracks the quantitative aspects of growth with validated JSON structure.
6. **`.gptignore`**: A file to help guide the AI's focus by excluding irrelevant files from its context.
7. **Daily Evolution System**: Automated daily maintenance cycles that keep the repository healthy and up-to-date.

## 🤖 Automated Daily Evolution (New in v0.2.1!)

The repository now includes an intelligent daily evolution system that automatically maintains code quality and consistency:

### 🌅 Daily Maintenance Features

- **Automated Health Checks**: Scans for inconsistencies, errors, and improvement opportunities
- **Smart Triggering**: Only runs when actual improvements are detected
- **Conservative Approach**: Focuses on safe, minimal changes by default
- **Command Line Interface**: On-demand evolution cycles with full control

### 🚀 Quick Daily Evolution Commands

```bash
# Run quick consistency check and fixes
./scripts/evolve.sh

# Documentation improvements
./scripts/evolve.sh --type documentation --intensity moderate

# Custom evolution with specific goals
./scripts/evolve.sh --type custom --prompt "Improve error handling in scripts"

# Dry run to preview changes
./scripts/evolve.sh --type code_quality --dry-run
```

**Daily Schedule**: Automatically runs at 3 AM UTC daily (configurable)
**On-Demand**: Use `./scripts/evolve.sh` anytime for immediate improvements

➡️ **[Complete Daily Evolution Guide](docs/DAILY_EVOLUTION.md)**

## 🚀 Quick Germination & Growth

```bash
# 1. Plant the v0.2.0 seed (if you haven't already)
# Ensure you're in an empty directory for a new project
# curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bamr87/ai-evolution-engine/main/init_setup.sh -o init_setup.sh # Get latest
# For this specific v0.2.0, ensure you're using the v0.2.0 version of this script.
bash init_setup.sh

# 2. Set your AI API Key (if using a real AI in the future)
# export AI_API_KEY="your_actual_ai_key_here"

# 3. Initiate a growth cycle via GitHub Actions
gh workflow run ai_evolver.yml -f prompt="Evolve the project to include a basic REST API for tracking plant growth." -f growth_mode="adaptive"
```
*(Requires GitHub CLI `gh` to be installed and authenticated)*

## 🧪 Evolution Generation 3.1: Testing & Build Automation

This evolution cycle focused on **real-world problem-solving** in CI/CD automation, derived from fixing actual issues in the zer0-mistakes Jekyll theme project.

### 🎯 Problems Solved & Solutions Encoded

| Issue Category | Problem | Solution | Pattern Encoded |
|---------------|---------|----------|-----------------|
| **Gemspec Validation** | `gem specification` failed on unbuilt gems | `ruby -c` syntax checking | Syntax validation patterns |
| **YAML Parsing** | `grep -q '---'` treated as option | `grep -q -- '---'` proper escaping | Argument escaping methods |
| **File Permissions** | Non-world-readable assets | Automated `chmod 644` corrections | Permission management |
| **Authentication** | `gem whoami` doesn't exist in RubyGems 3.x | Credential file checking | Version-agnostic auth |
| **Version Conflicts** | Republishing existing versions | Proactive remote registry checking | Conflict prevention |
| **Build Verification** | `gem contents` fails on uninstalled gems | `tar -tzf` for gem inspection | Alternative verification |
| **Dependencies** | Open-ended version constraints | Semantic versioning patterns | Dependency best practices |

### 🚀 Automation Capabilities

- **26 comprehensive test cases** with automated error resolution
- **Multi-format build support** (npm, gem, Makefile, generic)
- **Verbose debugging modes** for troubleshooting
- **Proactive conflict detection** before publish attempts
- **Self-healing scripts** that fix common issues automatically

### 🌱 Seeds Generated
