# Evolution Reports Directory

This directory contains evolution reports, analytics data, and final summaries from AI evolution cycles.

## Directory Contents

### Reports
- `evolution-final-report.md` - Final evolution cycle report with version correlations
- `version-changes.json` - JSON data tracking version changes and file modifications

## Purpose

The reports directory serves as an archive for:
- **Evolution Cycle Results**: Detailed reports from completed evolution cycles
- **Version Analytics**: Data tracking correlations between version increments and file changes
- **Performance Metrics**: System performance and evolution success metrics
- **Historical Data**: Archive of evolution patterns and outcomes

## Usage

These reports are primarily used for:
1. **Analysis**: Understanding evolution patterns and effectiveness
2. **Documentation**: Recording the history of system improvements
3. **Debugging**: Investigating issues in evolution cycles
4. **Planning**: Informing future evolution strategies

## Integration

Reports in this directory are:
- Generated automatically during evolution cycles
- Referenced by the main documentation
- Used by analytics and reporting tools
- Archived for historical analysis

## File Format Standards

All reports follow these conventions:
- **Markdown format** for human-readable reports
- **JSON format** for machine-readable data
- **Timestamped entries** for chronological tracking
- **Consistent naming** using evolution cycle identifiers
