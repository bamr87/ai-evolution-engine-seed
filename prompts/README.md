# Prompts Directory

This directory contains evolution prompts, growth instructions, and AI guidance documents that drive the evolution cycles of the AI Evolution Engine.

## Directory Contents

### Prompt Files
- `first_growth.md` - Initial growth prompt for starting evolution cycles
- `next_prompt.md` - Template for subsequent evolution prompts

## Purpose

The prompts directory serves as a repository for:
- **Evolution Instructions**: Specific prompts that guide AI evolution behavior
- **Growth Templates**: Reusable prompt templates for different evolution types
- **AI Guidance**: Instructions that define how the AI should approach different tasks
- **Evolution Strategies**: Prompts that implement specific evolution methodologies

## Prompt Types

### Growth Prompts
- **Initial Growth**: Starting prompts for new evolution cycles
- **Incremental Growth**: Prompts for ongoing development and improvement
- **Specialized Growth**: Targeted prompts for specific areas (testing, documentation, etc.)

### Instruction Templates
- **Reusable Templates**: Standard prompt formats for common operations
- **Customizable Prompts**: Templates that can be adapted for specific needs
- **Context-Specific**: Prompts tailored for particular development contexts

## Usage Guidelines

1. **Clear Instructions**: Prompts should be clear and specific
2. **Consistent Format**: Follow established prompt formatting conventions
3. **Version Control**: Track prompt changes and their effects
4. **Testing**: Validate prompts before using in production evolution cycles

## Best Practices

- **Specificity**: Make prompts as specific as possible for better results
- **Context**: Include relevant context and constraints
- **Goals**: Clearly define the desired outcomes
- **Safety**: Include appropriate safeguards and limitations
- **Evolution**: Update prompts based on results and learning
