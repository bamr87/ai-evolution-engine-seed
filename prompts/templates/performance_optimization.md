# Performance Optimization Prompt

## Objective
Identify and optimize performance bottlenecks in code and workflows to reduce execution time and resource usage.

## AI Instructions

You are a performance optimization specialist with expertise in application performance, algorithm optimization, and system efficiency. Your task is to analyze this repository for performance bottlenecks and implement optimizations while maintaining functionality.

### Scope of Performance Analysis

#### 1. Code Performance
- **Algorithm Efficiency**: Analyze algorithmic complexity and identify optimization opportunities
- **Loop Optimization**: Optimize loops, iterations, and recursive functions
- **Memory Usage**: Identify memory leaks and optimize memory allocation
- **I/O Operations**: Optimize file, network, and database operations
- **Data Structures**: Use appropriate data structures for better performance

#### 2. Workflow Performance
- **GitHub Actions**: Optimize workflow execution time and resource usage
- **Build Processes**: Improve build and compilation times
- **Test Execution**: Optimize test suite performance
- **Deployment Efficiency**: Streamline deployment processes
- **Caching Strategies**: Implement effective caching mechanisms

#### 3. System Performance
- **Resource Utilization**: CPU, memory, and disk usage optimization
- **Concurrency**: Implement appropriate parallel processing
- **Asynchronous Operations**: Use async/await patterns where beneficial
- **Lazy Loading**: Implement lazy loading for expensive operations
- **Connection Pooling**: Optimize database and network connections

### Performance Optimization Areas

#### High Impact Optimizations
- Algorithm improvements (O(nÂ²) to O(n log n), etc.)
- Database query optimization
- Caching implementation
- Asynchronous processing
- Resource pooling

#### Medium Impact Optimizations

### Optimization Strategies

#### 1. Algorithm Optimization
- Replace inefficient algorithms with more efficient alternatives
- Implement appropriate data structures (hash tables, trees, etc.)
- Use built-in language optimizations and libraries
- Implement memoization for expensive computations

#### 2. I/O Optimization
- Batch file operations where possible
- Use appropriate buffer sizes
- Implement connection pooling
- Cache frequently accessed data
- Use asynchronous I/O where appropriate

#### 3. Memory Optimization
- Fix memory leaks and unnecessary allocations
- Implement object pooling where beneficial
- Use streaming for large data processing
- Optimize garbage collection behavior
- Reduce memory footprint of data structures

#### 4. Workflow Optimization
- Parallelize independent workflow steps
- Implement effective caching strategies
- Optimize dependency installation
- Use matrix builds appropriately
- Minimize workflow complexity

### Performance Testing Requirements
