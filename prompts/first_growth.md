# ðŸŒ± First Growth Prompt (v0.2.0 Seed)

Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to guide the evolution of this nascent AI-driven repository.

**Initial Goal:** Evolve this project to include a simple "Idea Incubator" feature.

**Specifics:**
1.  **Core Logic (`src/idea_incubator.py` or similar):**
    *   A Python class or set of functions to manage a list of ideas.
    *   Each idea should have a description (string) and a status (e.g., "pending", "active", "completed", "archived").
    *   Ability to add a new idea.
    *   Ability to list all ideas.
    *   Ability to update an idea's status.
2.  **Basic CLI Interaction (Optional, if easy for AI):**
    *   A simple way to interact with the Idea Incubator from the command line (e.g., `python main.py add "My new idea"`).
3.  **Tests (`tests/test_idea_incubator.py`):**
    *   Basic unit tests for adding, listing, and updating ideas.
4.  **Documentation:**
    *   Update `README.md` with a new section describing the "Idea Incubator" feature. The AI should try to use a new marker block for this if it's advanced enough, or just add a section.
    *   Brief comments in the code.

**Growth Principles to Emphasize:**
- **Modularity**: Keep the idea incubator logic separate.
- **Testability**: Ensure new code is testable.
- **Clarity**: Code should be clear and well-commented where necessary.

Remember, the AI is currently simulated in `ai_evolver.yml`. Its actions will be based on the simulation logic in that workflow. The changes it makes (like creating files and updating README/metrics) are defined there.
This prompt will guide the *simulated* AI's output.
