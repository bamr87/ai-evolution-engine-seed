# ðŸŒ± AI Evolution Engine - Seed v0.2.0 ðŸŒ±

This is the bootstrap seed file for the AI Evolution Engine, version 0.2.0.
It describes the capabilities and structure of this specific seed generation.

## ðŸ§¬ Core Components of Seed v0.2.0

- **`README.md`**: Now features dynamic markers (`<!-- AI-EVOLUTION-MARKER:START -->` and `<!-- AI-EVOLUTION-MARKER:END -->`) for AI-driven updates on evolution status.
- **`init_setup.sh`**: A more robust germination script that initializes the full v0.2.0 environment, including this `.seed.md`, the primary `README.md`, the AI workflow, `.gitignore`, `.gptignore`, and essential configuration files.
- **`.github/workflows/ai_evolver.yml`**: An enhanced GitHub Actions workflow.
    - Simulates AI-driven evolution more deeply.
    - (Simulated) AI generates complete new versions of `README.md` and `evolution-metrics.json`.
    - Utilizes `.gptignore` for more focused context collection.
    - Dynamically generates a *new* `.seed.md` file after each growth cycle, outlining the next evolutionary step (e.g., towards v0.3.0).
- **`evolution-metrics.json`**: Tracks key metrics about the repository's growth and evolution.
- **`.gptignore`**: Allows fine-tuning of files included in the AI's context, improving focus and efficiency.
- **`.evolution.yml`**: Configuration for the evolution process.

## ðŸš€ How to Use This Seed

1.  **Plant**: Run `bash init_setup.sh` in a new project directory. This will lay down all the v0.2.0 files.
2.  **Nurture**: Trigger the `ai_evolver.yml` workflow with a prompt:
    ```bash
    gh workflow run ai_evolver.yml -f prompt="Your evolutionary goal here"
    ```
3.  **Observe**: A new branch will be created with changes (simulated by the AI). `README.md` and `evolution-metrics.json` will be updated. A new `.seed.md` pointing towards the next evolution (v0.3.0) will be generated.
4.  **Iterate**: Merge the changes and repeat the process.

## ðŸŒ± What's Next? (The Role of the *Generated* `.seed.md`)

After a growth cycle using `ai_evolver.yml`, a *new* `.seed.md` file will be created. That file will contain:
- A summary of the "learnings" or changes from that cycle.
- A blueprint for the *next* potential version (e.g., v0.3.0).
- Suggestions for features and improvements for the core evolution engine itself.

This current file (`.seed.md` created by `init_setup.sh`) serves as the stable description of the v0.2.0 seed. The one generated by the workflow is the forward-looking, evolving seed.
