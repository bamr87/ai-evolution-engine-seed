> 🌱 **Now with organized documentation! All docs properly structured in `/docs` following best practices for maintainable repositories.**

This repository is a living experiment in AI-driven software evolution. It's designed to adapt, learn, and improve itself with each "growth cycle," guided by your prompts and an AI engine.

## 🌿 Core Philosophy: Digital Symbiosis

We believe in software that grows organically, much like a plant from a seed. This involves:
- **Sustainability**: Each evolution builds upon stable foundations.
- **Adaptability**: The system learns and refines its growth patterns.
- **Acceleration**: AI handles boilerplate and complex transformations, letting humans focus on vision.

## 📚 Documentation Structure

Following our **Documentation Organization Rule**, all documentation resides in the `docs/` directory:

### Core Documentation (Repository Root)

- `README.md` - This file (main project documentation)
- `CHANGELOG.md` - Version history and change tracking

### Organized Documentation (`docs/`)

- `docs/guides/` - User guides and tutorials
- `docs/architecture/` - Technical architecture and design decisions
- `docs/evolution/` - Evolution cycle documentation and metrics
- `docs/workflows/` - CI/CD and automation documentation
- `docs/seeds/` - Seed templates and evolution prompts

**Key Benefits:**

- **Consistency**: Standardized location for all documentation
- **Maintainability**: Easy to find and update documentation
- **Scalability**: Clear structure supports growing documentation needs
- **Collaboration**: Team members always know where to find docs

## 🌍 Cross-Platform Evolution (New in v0.3.0!)

The AI Evolution Engine now runs everywhere with full cross-platform support:

### 🏠 Local Development
- **Native execution** on macOS, Linux, and Windows
- **Automatic dependency management** with OS-specific package managers
- **Interactive local runner** with `./scripts/local-evolution.sh`

### 🐳 Containerized Environment
- **Docker support** for isolated, reproducible environments
- **Pre-built container** with all dependencies included
- **Volume mounting** for seamless local development integration

### ☁️ CI/CD Ready
- **GitHub Actions** with enhanced authentication handling
- **Multiple token strategies** (PAT_TOKEN, GITHUB_TOKEN)
- **Container option** for pipeline isolation

**Quick Start Options:**
```bash
# Local development (native)
./scripts/local-evolution.sh -p "Your evolution prompt"

# Container development

- **Conservative Approach**: Focuses on safe, minimal changes by default
- **Command Line Interface**: On-demand evolution cycles with full control

### 🚀 Quick Daily Evolution Commands

```bash
# Run quick consistency check and fixes
./scripts/evolve.sh

# Documentation improvements
./scripts/evolve.sh --type documentation --intensity moderate

# Custom evolution with specific goals
./scripts/evolve.sh --type custom --prompt "Improve error handling in scripts"

# Dry run to preview changes
./scripts/evolve.sh --type code_quality --dry-run
```

**Daily Schedule**: Automatically runs at 3 AM UTC daily (configurable)
**On-Demand**: Use `./scripts/evolve.sh` anytime for immediate improvements

➡️ **[Complete Daily Evolution Guide](docs/DAILY_EVOLUTION.md)**

## 🚀 Quick Germination & Growth

```bash
# 1. Plant the v0.2.0 seed (if you haven't already)
# Ensure you're in an empty directory for a new project
# curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bamr87/ai-evolution-engine/main/init_setup.sh -o init_setup.sh # Get latest
# For this specific v0.2.0, ensure you're using the v0.2.0 version of this script.
bash init_setup.sh

# 2. Set your AI API Key (if using a real AI in the future)
# export AI_API_KEY="your_actual_ai_key_here"

# 3. Initiate a growth cycle via GitHub Actions
gh workflow run ai_evolver.yml -f prompt="Evolve the project to include a basic REST API for tracking plant growth." -f growth_mode="adaptive"
```
*(Requires GitHub CLI `gh` to be installed and authenticated)*

## 🏗️ Modular Architecture (New in v0.3.1!)

The AI Evolution Engine features a completely refactored modular architecture for improved maintainability, testing, and extensibility:

### 📦 Core Libraries

**`src/lib/core/`** - Foundation libraries used across all scripts:

- **`logger.sh`** - Unified logging with color support and CI/local awareness
- **`environment.sh`** - Environment detection, OS handling, and command checking
- **`testing.sh`** - Comprehensive test framework with assertions and reporting

**`src/lib/evolution/`** - Evolution-specific functionality:

- **`git.sh`** - Git operations (branching, committing, pushing)
- **`metrics.sh`** - Evolution metrics tracking and analysis

### 🔧 Refactored Scripts

Scripts now use modular imports instead of inline duplicated code:

```bash
# Before: Inline logging and environment detection
echo "Starting process..."

# After: Modular approach
source "$PROJECT_ROOT/src/lib/core/logger.sh"
source "$PROJECT_ROOT/src/lib/core/environment.sh"
log_info "Starting process..."
```

**Currently Refactored:**

- ✅ `evolve.sh` - Main evolution orchestrator
- ✅ `ai-debug-helper.sh` - Debug information collector
- ✅ `analyze-repository-health.sh` - Health analysis
- ✅ `apply-growth-changes.sh` - Change application
- ✅ `check-prereqs.sh` - Prerequisite validation
- ✅ `collect-context.sh` - Context gathering
- ✅ `generate-evolution-prompt.sh` - Prompt generation
- ✅ `local-evolution.sh` - Local development runner
- ✅ `setup-environment.sh` - Environment setup
- ✅ `test-workflow.sh` - Workflow testing
- ✅ `update-evolution-metrics.sh` - Metrics updates

### 🧪 Enhanced Testing Framework

- **Modular test suites** for each library component
- **Integration testing** between libraries
- **Backward compatibility validation**
- **Comprehensive test reporting** with JSON and Markdown outputs
